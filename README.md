# DiceCalc #

DiceCalc is a calculator-themed pseudorandom dice roller.  It differs from
most other dice-rolling programs in that it operates with dice formula
strings, which many tabletop gamers will be familiar with from source books
and command-line or IRC bot dice rollers.  It uses a GUI resembling a pocket
calculator because I think it is cool.  I also think it's an eficient way to
type dice formulas.  However, the Dice and DiceParser classes may be used
separately for other formula-based dice rollers.
